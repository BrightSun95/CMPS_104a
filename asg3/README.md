#Asignment 3

Now we create a real parser to replace the dummy one 
in our previous project. The scanner scans the tokens
and based upon the grammatical rules we have defined
in our parser bison will parse accordingly. We will
define a set of rules to input what is parsed into
an abstract syntax tree.

Given file.oc the program outputs
file.str file.tok file.ast
